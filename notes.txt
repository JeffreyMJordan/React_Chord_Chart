It seems like I need to do a few things 
I need to receive the matrix, then the group names 
From these, I need to draw the arcs and the chords 


Other code I've seen draws the arcs and the labels at the same time - seems to make sense 
To make an arc, I use svg path then d3 to calculate the route (or arc, in this case)
I pass the d3 calculation to the path's
